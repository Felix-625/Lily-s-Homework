This solution calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to sort the array in either ascending or descending order, as both are considered beautiful. For each sorting direction, it counts swaps by iterating through the array and swapping misplaced elements to their correct positions while tracking element locations with a dictionary for efficiency. Finally, it returns the smaller swap count between the ascending and descending order arrangements.
